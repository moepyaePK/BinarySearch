You've asked to refactor the provided code snippet to implement **Insertion Sort** instead of Binary Search, while also considering performance, readability, and security. This is a complete change of the algorithm's purpose, so we'll replace the `BinarySearch` class with an `InsertionSort` class.

Here's the refactored code:

```java
/**
 * Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm for an array of integers.
 * Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array
 * (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than
 * more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * However, it has some advantages:
 * - Simple implementation.
 * - Efficient for small data sets.
 * - Efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted.
 * - Stable (does not change the relative order of elements with equal values).
 * - In-place (only requires a constant amount O(1) of additional memory space).
 */
public class InsertionSort {

    /**
     * Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
     * This method modifies the input array directly (in-place sort).
     *
     * Performance Characteristics:
     * - Time Complexity (Worst Case / Average Case): O(n^2) comparisons and swaps.
     *   This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order.
     * - Time Complexity (Best Case): O(n) comparisons and O(1) swaps.
     *   This occurs when the array is already sorted.
     * - Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place algorithm, uses a constant amount of extra memory).
     *
     * Readability:
     * - Uses descriptive variable names like `currentElement` and `j`.
     * - Comments explain the logic of the inner and outer loops.
     *
     * Security/Robustness:
     * - Includes a null check for the input array to prevent NullPointerExceptions.
     *   Throws an `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid input, promoting robust error handling.
     * - Operates on primitive arrays in Java, which inherently prevents common memory-related
     *   security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows due to JVM's array bounds checking.
     *
     * @param arr The array of integers to be sorted. Must not be null.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the input array `arr` is null.

    public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {

        if (arr == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input array cannot be null for insertionSort.");
        }

        int n = arr.length;
        // The outer loop iterates from the second element to the end of the array.
        // It considers elements one by one and inserts them into their correct position
        // within the already sorted sub-array to its left.

            // Readability: 'j' is used to traverse the sorted sub-array (from right to left).
            // It points to the last element of the sorted sub-array.

### Summary of Refactoring and Justification:

1.  **Change of Algorithm/Purpose:**
    *   The original `BinarySearch` class has been completely replaced with an `InsertionSort` class, fulfilling your request to "refactor the repo to be insertion sort."
    *   The `binarySearch` methods are removed, and a new `insertionSort` method is added.

2.  **Performance:**
    *   **Algorithm Choice:** Insertion sort is chosen as requested. Its performance characteristics (O(n^2) average/worst case, O(n) best case, O(1) space) are clearly documented in the Javadoc. While not optimal for very large datasets, it's efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays.
    *   **Implementation Efficiency:** The `insertionSort` method implements the standard algorithm efficiently, avoiding unnecessary operations. The use of `currentElement` reduces array access within the inner loop.

3.  **Readability:**
    *   **Class and Method Naming:** The class is now `InsertionSort`, and the primary method is `insertionSort`, clearly indicating its purpose.
    *   **Javadoc Comments:** Comprehensive Javadoc comments are added to the class and the `insertionSort` method. These explain the algorithm's purpose, its performance characteristics, and how to use it.
    *   **Inline Comments:** Within the `insertionSort` method, comments explain the logic of the loops and variable roles, making the code easier to follow step-by-step.
    *   **Meaningful Variable Names:** `arr`, `currentElement`, `i`, and `j` are standard and descriptive for this algorithm.
    *   **Main Method for Demonstration:** The `main` method now clearly demonstrates how to use the `insertionSort` method with various test cases (unsorted, reverse-sorted, already sorted, empty, single-element arrays), which aids in understanding and testing.

4.  **Security and Robustness:**
    *   **Null Input Handling:** The `insertionSort` method now explicitly checks if the input `arr` is `null`. If it is, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown, preventing a `NullPointerException` and making the method more robust against invalid inputs. This is a crucial aspect of secure and reliable code.
    *   **Array Bounds Safety:** Java's built-in array bounds checking inherently protects against buffer overflow vulnerabilities that can occur in languages like C/C++. The implementation relies on this JVM feature for safety.
    *   **No Sensitive Data Exposure:** A sorting algorithm on primitive integers generally does not involve external resources or sensitive data handling, so direct security concerns like SQL injection or cross-site scripting are not applicable here. The focus is on robust input handling and preventing runtime errors.
